# Multi-Temporal-Images-based-Farm-Yield-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This project contains deep learning based farm-wise crop yield prediction using multi-temporal satellite images

This repository contains farm-wise crop yield data taken from KBS LTER site in Michigan, USA

Python scripts contain pre-processing procedures, data cleaning, data augmentation and deep learning neural network which aids in finding farm-level crop yield
